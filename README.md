I am archiving this version of the app, since I already stopped working on it long time ago. There are way too many clones of this game on the google play store making money with my work with ads and this made me lose the desire to work on it completely. I am planning to update the game to put it on the google playstore again, but not as opensource anymore. I am sorry for that change, but I have no other way to keep me interested in working at this app.

# Simple-Brick-Games
You can find screenshots for phones [here](./screenshots)

This is litteraly my first Android app and even my first greater project. So please have sympathy that my code style isn't the best. 
I already made some improvements, but I don't want to put too much time in that.

I tried to make it easy to add more subgames in this app.

# Description
This game imitates the good old low cost handhelds

* 14 different mini games
* customizable background, buttons and textures
* highscores for each game
* changeable speed and level for each game


Navigation in main menu, press:
 * left or right to change game
 * up to increase level
 * down to increase speed
 * action button to start game

## Usage
If you want to use my work for your own project (which means in most cases: Put ads in it and publish on Google Play Store) YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE GPL LICENSE! This means, your project MUST be open source under a GPLv3+ compatible license and MUST contain attribution for the original work! I already found a lot of copies which simply removed my "About Game" screen and changed some graphics. If I see your work violating the GPL rules, I will let it get removed by Google. 

So please follow the rules! Use this attribution text (or a similar one)
